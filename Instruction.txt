Project Idea:

I was thinking about the food lovers and restaurant owners. As we can see, sometimes
food lovers canâ€™t always know instantly about the available offers provided by the restaurants and what
kind of foods they can get there. And sometimes, restaurants owners have to go through some problems
as they have to spend a huge amount of money for promoting issues like leaflets and advertising. So, here
I got the idea to do something which may help them instantly in these type of situations such as when
they need to find available restaurants offers and know about the foods and reviews and on the other
hand, it would similarly help the restaurants owners on their business purposes like advertising and
promoting new businesses.

Features:
1. Login System.
2. Users can rate, review and upload pictures of the restaurant and dishes they have tested.
3. Restaurant owners can post new updates and Offers.
4. User can see how much restaurant are there besides his area.
5. And I will try to add more features if possible.

Platform: Web
Project Title: Foodies
Tools: HTML, PHP, JavaScript, MySql, framework (Codeigniter), etc.
